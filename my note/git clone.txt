Go to the repository you forked in the previous step
Click on the "clone or download button" (see pictures below).
Copy the URL that is there. It looks something like https://github.com/YOUR-USER/mooc-software-testing.git.
Open your terminal (command prompt, bash, ...). If you are using Windows, you just installed the Git Bash utility.
Navigate to the directory where you want to save the project (using the "cd" command).
Type "git clone URL", where URL is the link you copied in step 3.
Press enter and wait for the process to finish.
